# Basic Queue ADT

This Java project implements a basic Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) using an interface and ArrayList.

## Classes

- `Queue` Interface: Defines queue methods - enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, and size.
- `ArrayQueue` Class: Implements the `Queue` interface with ArrayList storage.
- `Main` Class: Demonstrates queue operations.


# Basic Polymorphism

This Java project demonstrates polymorphism by implementing shapes (Circle and Rectangle) using inheritance and method overriding.

## Classes

- `Shape` Abstract Class: Represents a shape with name and area.
- `Circle` Class: Subclass for circles, calculates area.
- `Rectangle` Class: Subclass for rectangles, calculates area.
- `Main` Class: Demonstrates polymorphism.


# Basic Abstract Class 

This Java project showcases abstract classes and polymorphism by modeling vehicles (Car and Motorcycle) and their behaviors.

## Classes

- `Vehicle` Abstract Class: Represents a vehicle with make and year, provides start, stop, and displayInfo methods.
- `Car` Class: Subclass for cars with numDoors, implements start and stop.
- `Motorcycle` Class: Subclass for motorcycles with type, implements start and stop.
- `Main` Class: Demonstrates abstract classes and polymorphism.

# Student Management System

This Java project manages student records using ArrayLists and provides functionality for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student information.

## Classes

- `Student`: Represents a student with student ID, first name, last name, and GPA.
- `StudentManagementSystem`: Manages student records using an ArrayList and provides methods to interact with the records.
- `Program`: Implements a menu-driven console interface for interacting with the Student Management System.


# Basic Single Linked List

This Java project implements a singly linked list data structure with nodes and basic operations.

## Classes:

- `Node `: Represents a node with data and a reference to the next node.
- `SinglyLinkedList` Class: Represents a singly linked list and provides methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
- `Main` : Demonstrates the use of the SinglyLinkedList class.

# Basic Double Linked List
This Java project implements a doubly linked list data structure with nodes and basic operations.

## Classes:

- `Node` : Represents a node with data and references to the next and previous nodes.
- `DoublyLinkedList` : Represents a doubly linked list and provides methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
- `Main` : Demonstrates the use of the DoublyLinkedList class.
