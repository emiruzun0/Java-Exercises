# Basic Queue ADT

This Java project implements a basic Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) using an interface and ArrayList.

## Classes

- `Queue` Interface: Defines queue methods - enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, and size.
- `ArrayQueue` Class: Implements the `Queue` interface with ArrayList storage.
- `Main` Class: Demonstrates queue operations.


# Basic Polymorphism

This Java project demonstrates polymorphism by implementing shapes (Circle and Rectangle) using inheritance and method overriding.

## Classes

- `Shape` Abstract Class: Represents a shape with name and area.
- `Circle` Class: Subclass for circles, calculates area.
- `Rectangle` Class: Subclass for rectangles, calculates area.
- `Main` Class: Demonstrates polymorphism.


# Basic Abstract Class 

This Java project showcases abstract classes and polymorphism by modeling vehicles (Car and Motorcycle) and their behaviors.

## Classes

- `Vehicle` Abstract Class: Represents a vehicle with make and year, provides start, stop, and displayInfo methods.
- `Car` Class: Subclass for cars with numDoors, implements start and stop.
- `Motorcycle` Class: Subclass for motorcycles with type, implements start and stop.
- `Main` Class: Demonstrates abstract classes and polymorphism.
